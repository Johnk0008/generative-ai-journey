## 📌 About This Repository
This repository is my **daily log of Generative AI learning**.  
Every day I will:
- Build a **small project or code snippet**  
- Document my learnings in a folder (e.g., `Day-01`, `Day-02`)  
- Update this README with progress ✅  
- Share results on **LinkedIn + GitHub** to stay consistent  

Goal 🎯 → To showcase **consistency + practical skills** to Big Tech recruiters (Google, Amazon, etc.) and anyone following along.
